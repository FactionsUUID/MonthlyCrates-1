# MonthlyCrates

Welcome to the Official Bug Report Forum for MonthlyCrates. Please Report and issues to me using the Issues Tracker. I do my best to read these daily.

# Open Source:
Thanks for the support since taking over this project, we've hit 1,000 downloads in 2 weeks. I have decided to re-code the entire plugin, adding and improving features. So, here is the 1.0x series Source Code for you to edit if you wish to :)


# Note:
I will not give assistance for anybody using a different Monthly Crates Plugin. I only help those using my MonthlyCrates Plugin.
