# MonthlyCrates

Welcome to the Official Bug Report Forum for MonthlyCrates. Please Report and issues to me using the Issues Tracker. I do my best to read these daily.

# Note:
I will not give assistance for anybody using a different Monthly Crates Plugin. I only help those using my MonthlyCrates Plugin.
